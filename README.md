# ISL_Data_Set
ISLRTC Referred

The dataset contains 1,000 images per class, making a dataset of 36,000 images, and the following image preprocessing techniques were applied to the dataset. The dimensions of the images are 250*250 with different backgrounds. This dataset was created in response to a major project at ISL. Images were captured using a 720p laptop camera with different lighting conditions and backgrounds.
The dataset was created using the characters demonstrated on the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Center (ISLRTC) website, which we took as a reference to create a dataset with 1000 images per character for Indian Sign Language.

I also split it in the ratio of 10:3
